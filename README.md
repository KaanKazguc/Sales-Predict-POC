# AI Assistant POC That Calculates Sales Estimate for a Possible Market by Examining Surrounding Market Shopping Information

I have implemented the proof of concept of an artificial intelligence assistant that can estimate how much sales a potential store will make based on the sales information of stores in the same category in the vicinity. I worked with synthetic data on market sales to embody this concept, but it can be implemented for all types of stores that are located more than one in close proximity, such as restaurants and coffee shops. The people who can use the project prepared for use in a project are chain owners, wholesalers, and e-courier platform owners who have sales information of similar concept stores nearby.

Suppose we go a little more abstractly in the project. It is also possible to use it as an artificial intelligence that estimates the needs of nearby stores by looking at the products purchased through e-commerce.

`SERVER_NAME`

## Optimization

I wrote my own code that only calculates the co-occurrence rates to make the association analysis a bit faster. If you want to get more statistical data, you can use the industry standard `mlxtend` library.
